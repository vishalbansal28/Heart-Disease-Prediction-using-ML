# Heart Disease Detection Using Machine Learning

This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on various medical parameters. The project utilizes Python programming language and popular libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Project Overview

- `heart_disease_detection.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the entire project code.
- `heart.csv`: Dataset file containing the necessary data for heart disease prediction.
- `requirements.txt : Contains all the requirement files and their versions.
## How to Use

1. Download the `heart_disease_detection.ipynb` and `heart.csv` files to your local machine.
2. Open the Jupyter notebook in your preferred environment (Jupyter Notebook, JupyterLab, etc.).
3. Follow the instructions and execute each code cell sequentially to load the dataset, preprocess the data, train machine learning models, and evaluate the model performance.
4. Analyze the results, visualizations, and model accuracy provided within the notebook.

## Requirements

Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:

- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

You can install these libraries using pip:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Tech Stack:
